    <p>Sasuke is introduced in the third chapter of Naruto's manga as a young ninja assigned to become a member of Team 7 alongside his rival Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno, the latter of whom is infatuated with him. The trio are trained under the guidance of Kakashi Hatake. Although Sasuke is antisocial, cold, and distant, he starts caring about Naruto and Sakura. During a mission, Sasuke awakens his Sharingan — his clan's inherited ability to see through illusions — which allows him to learn imperceptible movements at a superhuman rate. It is revealed later that Sasuke is the sole survivor of the once-powerful Uchiha clan of Konohagakure. He, at the age of seven, survived the massacre of his clan perpetrated by his brother, Itachi, who spared Sasuke's life because he did not consider him worth killing. Sasuke seeks strong fighting opponents to reassure himself his power is growing.</p>
    <p>During a ninja examination meant to improve their ranks, Team 7 encounters Orochimaru, an exile from Konohagakure who afflicts Sasuke with a Cursed Seal that contains a fragment of Orochimaru's consciousness, which increases Sasuke's physical abilities, but makes him cruel and sadistic. Kakashi teaches Sasuke the lightning-based offensive technique called Chidori in an attempt to appease Sasuke's desire for power. During a siege of Konohagakure, a berserker ninja named Gaara beats Sasuke, who is rescued by Naruto. Shortly afterward, Itachi returns to the village; Sasuke tries to kill him, but he is beaten and tortured instead. Shaken by the experience he decides to leave Team 7 and Konohagakure to become stronger. Thinking Orochimaru's training will make him more powerful, Sasuke becomes an outlaw. Naruto follows him and they fight when Sasuke refuses to return; Sasuke wins, spares Naruto's life, and continues to Orochimaru's hideout.</p>

    <p>After two-and-a-half years of training, Sasuke absorbs Orochimaru before he can possess his younger body. Following this, Sasuke forms Team Hebi to find Itachi. Itachi and Sasuke fight and Itachi dies at the climax of the battle from an illness. Sasuke then meets Tobi, Itachi's superior, who reveals that Itachi killed the Uchiha clan under orders from Konohagakure and spared Sasuke out of love rather than contempt. Sasuke rejoins Hebi — which he renames Taka — and declares his intention to destroy his former village in retribution. Due to his brother's death, Sasuke's Sharingan has evolved into a Mangekyo Sharingan, giving him powerful new techniques. After he agrees to work temporarily for Tobi's terrorist organization, Akatsuki, Sasuke becomes a criminal. He kills Danzo Shimura — a mastermind of the Uchiha massacre and the acting Hokage, the leader of Konohagakure, at the time. Sasuke is confronted by his former Team 7 colleagues, and Naruto challenges him to a death match.</p>
    <p>Sasuke initially prepares to fight Naruto but instead decides to protect Konohagakure after he encounters the re-animated bodies of Itachi and the First Hokage. He rejoins Team 7 and fights the Ten-Tails monster that is controlled by the masterminds behind Akatsuki. Sasuke inherits the Rinnegan — a legendary eye technique — from the spirit of the Sage of the Six Paths Hagoromo Otsutsuki, the Founder of Shinobi. Team 7 fights and seals an ancient being called Kaguya Otsutsuki — Hagoromo's mother — who created the Ten-Tails. Sasuke then fights Naruto alone to settle their village's future; when he loses his left arm, Sasuke surrenders and reconciles with Naruto. Sasuke then destroys Akatsuki's illusion placed on mankind with his Rinnegan. He is pardoned for his crimes by Kakashi — the current Hokage — and decides to travel the world in search of redemption. Before leaving, he says farewell to both Sakura and Naruto with gratitude. By the end of the manga, having briefly returned to the village, Sasuke is revealed to have married Sakura who is raising their daughter Sarada.</p>
